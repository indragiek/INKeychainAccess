## This code is deprecated

**INKeychainAccess is deprecated and will not be maintained anymore. You should not use this code going forward.** My official recommended alternative is [SSKeychain](https://github.com/samsoffes/sskeychain) by Sam Soffes, which is also an iOS/OS X Keychain wrapper but is far better in many areas like error handling.


## ~~INKeychainAccess~~

`INKeychainAccess` is a simple Objective-C wrapper around Keychain Services on both Mac OS X and iOS. This code maintains a consistent API across both platforms.

**Note:** This code has only been extensively tested on the Mac. If you find any issues with it please open an issue.

## Adding INKeychainAccess to your project

1. Link against `Security.framework`. 
2. Add the `INKeychainAccess` source code files!
